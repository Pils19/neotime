----------------------------------------
Temporal types with nanosecond precision
----------------------------------------

The ``neotime`` module defines classes for working with temporal data to nanosecond precision.
These classes comprise a similar set to that provided by the standard library ``datetime`` module.
Inspiration has also been drawn from ISO-8601.


Overview
========

The classes are listed below:

* `Duration <#duration-objects>`_
* `Date <#date-objects>`_
* `Time <#time-objects>`_
* TODO


Installation
============

.. note::

    Neotime is currently alpha software.


To install the latest stable version of neotime, simply use pip:

.. code-block::

    $ pip install --pre neotime


Or to install the latest bleeding edge code directly from GitHub, use:

.. code-block::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/technige/neotime.git#egg=neotime

Note that code installed directly from GitHub is likely to be unstable.
Your mileage may vary.
